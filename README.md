 Animal Zoo: OOP in Java

A simple and fun Java project to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like **inheritance**, **constructors**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism** â€” using animals and pets as examples.



 Overview

This project features a small zoo of animals (including pets like cats and dogs) that all "speak" in their own way. It highlights how superclass references can point to subclass instances and how overridden methods are dynamically dispatched.



OOP Concepts Used

Inheritance (`is-a` relationships)
Superclass constructor chaining with `super`
Method overriding with `@Override`
Polymorphism with superclass arrays



Sample Output

```text
squeak
Hi, my name is 'Dandy'. I go 'Woof'!!!
Hi, my name is 'Bianca'. I go 'Meow'!!!
Hi, my name is 'Rocky the Pet Rock'. I go '...'!!!
